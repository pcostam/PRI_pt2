A 26-year-old male suffering from sudden right lower abdominal pain and lumbago was referred to our hospital. Enhanced computed tomography demonstrated bilateral kidneys and spleen infarctions, and a large tumour was found occupying the aortic arch and thoracic descending aorta. We suspected that these infarctions were due to tumour embolization. The aortic arch and thoracic descending aorta were resected with the tumour and then reconstructed using the L-incision technique. A microscopic examination revealed the presence of an intimal sarcoma. The patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and showed a good postoperative course. Neither recurrence nor metastasis has been observed during the 3 years since the operation.
